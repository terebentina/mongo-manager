# mongo-syllabus

[![Build Status][travis-image]][travis-url]

React based Mongodb admin interface. Currently work in progress but `master` is already in an usable state.

This is as much a playground for me to experiment with various current frontend development tools as it is a tool I badly
 needed when working with mongodb.

## Interested in helping out?
